[13/12/23, 11:40:33 PM] Amit Manjhavar Sir: It is observed that few students are giving entry to their outsider friends which is serious threat to security of the Institute. All the students are instructed not to bring such people in the campus, else strict disciplinary action will be taken against the student.
